                at <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a> where I primarily work with <a

              <p align="justify">In a past life, I heavily worked on Systems. I was a Senior Software Developer for 3

              <p align="justify">
                I’m interested in building intelligent agents that are capable of <i>communicating</i> with humans via <i>natural language</i> and are able to perform <i>tasks</i>. Towards this larger goal, I'm currently focusing on three main research directions
              <ul>
                <li><b>Teaching via language</b> - Currently, most learning-based robots are taught via hundreds of
                  demonstrations of a task. Humans, however, can be easily taught using natural language instructions. I am interested in using language as a medium of instructing and teaching robots. </li>
                <li><b>Vision and Language grounding</b> - Most existing image captioning models require paired
                  training data - thousands of annotated examples to ground language tokens to visual concepts. If
                  we were to deploy robots that communicate with humans in natural language, they would have to
                  learn novel visual concepts without paired data.  </li>
                <li><b>Language generation </b> - Most language models still aren't semantically accurate
                (GPT-2 writes about ‘fires happening under water’). I believe this is because current language models are text-only models, whereas human language understanding happens via <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1080/17470210701623605">visual and motor controls</a>. I believe language models built using embodied signals will demonstrate better language understanding and are likely to produce semantically accurate sentences.  </li>
